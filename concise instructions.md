The readme.md file has the long winded instructions in it.
This may make the process seem too complex and daunting.

If you are familiar with the concepts of file copying, and configuration directories and want a quick and simple set of instructions then you are in the right place.

## Procedure:
Make sure Crochet Charts is not running.
1. find your configuration directory
   - In a file browser, typing %localappdata% into the address bar
   - you should end up in a folder like this:
      - C:\Users\userloginname\AppData\Local\Stitch Works Software\Crochet Charts
   - if you have made any stitch changes in Crochet Charts then hold onto them for later by:
      - rename this folder to (say) "Crochet Charts original". This will preserve it.
   - Start Crochet charts and a replacement default folder will be created. We will be doing everything in here
 
 2. Create a subfolder in your configuration folder called newstitches. (we will be putting all the new stitch files in here)
 3. Download all the .bat, .xml and .zip files into the configuration folder
    - the xml files will add the stitch files (after you have got the config file setup in the step 5)
 4. Unzip all the stitch files into the newstitches folder
    - no subdirectories, all svg files at top level in newstitches folder.
 5. Run all the batch files (double click on them)
    - except far.bat which is called by each bat file to rename the config directory within each xml file.
 6. Open Crochet Charts
 7. Navigate to the Stitch Library (ctr-L) or 'Tools/Stitch Library'
 8. One at a time select the items in 'Stitch Source' (except default).
 9. For each Stitch source (except default)
    - Select each stitch (tick in checkbox) until all are selected.
    - Click on 'Add To List' to set/swap these stitches for the ones in Default.
    - You will be prompted to replace any existing stitches - agree.
    
 You have updated all the stitches. Go ahead and use Crochet charts. Remember to use a row grid size of 30x30 to get good initial spacing.
